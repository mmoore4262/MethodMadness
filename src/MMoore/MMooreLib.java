             What is missing in completing the functionality:
            -Have not defined the set of instructions needed to find GCF
            -Have not determined whether the function needs recursion to work.

             Tasks accomplished/things that need to be tested:
            -Finish GCF brainstorming/implementation**/
        //GCF determiner.
